Create Lightbar Configuration Files\n\n**MSGHDR.BAR** (new file in `/opt/vision3/menus/v3/bar/`)\n- Format: `X,Y,HiLitedColor,RegularColor,HotKey,ReturnValue,HiLitedString`\n- Auto-generate entries for each discovered template\n- Example:\n  ```\n  10,8,31,7,1,1,Simple Header (MSGHDR.1)\n  10,9,31,7,2,2,Classic Box (MSGHDR.2)\n  10,10,31,7,3,3,Colorful (MSGHDR.3)\n  ...\n  ```\n\n**MSGHDR.CFG** (new file in `/opt/vision3/menus/v3/cfg/`)\n- JSON format mapping hotkeys to actions\n- Map numeric keys (1-N) to PREVIEW command with template number\n- Add Q for quit, ENTER for select\n\n### 2. Modify runGetHeaderType() Function\n\n**Changes to `internal/menu/message_reader.go`:**\n1. Auto-discover all MSGHDR.*.ans files using `filepath.Glob()`\n2. Sort templates numerically (MSGHDR.1, MSGHDR.2, ..., MSGHDR.15, etc.)\n3. Load lightbar options using `loadLightbarOptions()` (already exists in executor.go)\n4. Replace simple input loop with lightbar navigation:\n   - Arrow keys to navigate\n   - ENTER to preview selected template\n   - Space or hotkey to select and save\n   - Q to quit without changing\n5. Keep existing preview functionality with sample data\n6. Update user's header preference on selection\n\n### 3. Update or Replace MSGHDR.ANS\n\n**Option A:** Keep MSGHDR.ANS as static background, overlay lightbar items\n**Option B:** Create new MSGHDR_SELECT.ANS with space for dynamic list\n\n### 4. Template Discovery Logic\n\n```go\nfunc discoverMessageHeaders(templatesPath string) ([]string, error) {\n    pattern := filepath.Join(templatesPath, \"message_headers\", \"MSGHDR.*.ans\")\n    files, err := filepath.Glob(pattern)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    \n    // Filter out MSGHDR.ANS (selection screen, not a template)\n    var headers []string\n    for _, file := range files {\n        base := filepath.Base(file)\n        if base == \"MSGHDR.ANS\" {\n            continue\n        }\n        headers = append(headers, base)\n    }\n    \n    // Sort numerically\n    sort.Slice(headers, func(i, j int) bool {\n        numI := extractNumber(headers[i])\n        numJ := extractNumber(headers[j])\n        return numI \u003c numJ\n    })\n    \n    return headers, nil\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. ✅ Create detailed implementation plan (this issue)\n2. ⬜ Create template discovery function\n3. ⬜ Design MSGHDR_SELECT.ANS background (or modify existing MSGHDR.ANS)\n4. ⬜ Generate MSGHDR.BAR configuration\n5. ⬜ Generate MSGHDR.CFG command mappings\n6. ⬜ Refactor runGetHeaderType() to use lightbar system\n7. ⬜ Add keyboard navigation (arrows, ENTER, Q)\n8. ⬜ Preserve preview functionality\n9. ⬜ Test with 14 existing templates\n10. ⬜ Test with 20+ templates (add more MSGHDR files)\n11. ⬜ Update documentation\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `internal/menu/message_reader.go` (runGetHeaderType function)\n- Create: `menus/v3/bar/MSGHDR.BAR`\n- Create: `menus/v3/cfg/MSGHDR.CFG`\n- Modify or replace: `menus/v3/templates/message_headers/MSGHDR.ANS`\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\n- [ ] Lightbar navigation works (up/down arrows)\n- [ ] ENTER previews selected template with sample data\n- [ ] Space or hotkey selects template and saves to user profile\n- [ ] Q quits without changing preference\n- [ ] System discovers all MSGHDR.*.ans files automatically\n- [ ] Works with 14 existing templates\n- [ ] Works with 20+ templates (test scalability)\n- [ ] No 14-item limit in code\n- [ ] Preview shows correct placeholder replacements\n- [ ] Selection persists to user profile\n\n## References\n\n- Existing lightbar implementation: `internal/menu/executor.go` (loadLightbarOptions, drawLightbarMenu)\n- Matrix menu example: `internal/menu/matrix.go` (RunMatrixScreen)\n- BAR format example: `menus/v3/bar/FASTLOGN.BAR`\n- Current header selection: `internal/menu/message_reader.go` (lines 1037-1117)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"robbiew@gmail.com","estimated_minutes":240,"created_at":"2026-02-15T16:08:53.827193973Z","created_by":"RobbieW","updated_at":"2026-02-15T16:18:31.43383003Z","closed_at":"2026-02-15T16:18:31.43383003Z","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["enhancement","lightbar","message-headers"]}
