# SSH Host Keys

ViSiON/3 requires SSH host keys to operate. Generate them with:

```bash
cd configs/
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ssh_host_rsa_key -N ""
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ssh_host_ed25519_key -N ""
ssh-keygen -t dsa -f ssh_host_dsa_key -N ""
```

The BBS will fail to start without at least the RSA key.

IMPORTANT: Never commit these keys to version control!
